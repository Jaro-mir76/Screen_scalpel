Functionality added by myself:
- user can define in settings location for saving screenshots and can open from app finder window showing this location,
- import of images from screenshot folder,
- saving screenshots directly to a file in user defined location,
- functionality accessible in different ways: keyboard shortcuts, context menu,
- import image using continuity camera,
- export using share link.
