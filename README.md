# Screen_scalpel
Simple app for making screenshots.
Base of this app was inspired and created based on tutorial of Karin Prater, link below:

Functionality added by myself:
- user can define in settings location for saving screenshots and can open from app finder window showing this location,
- saving screenshots directly to a file in user defined location,
- ... more will be added once it is added in the app,
